# Loader-Redux (Ultimate Belts)
Updated to work with Ultimate Belts.

I didn't balance this properly. Feel free to suggest adjustments to the recipes.

Based on the Loader Redux mod  
[Github](https://github.com/Yousei9/Loader-Redux)  
[Factorio Mod Portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/LoaderRedux)  


Adds Loaders.
Rewritten add-loader with new loader snapping logic.
